- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with refresh tokens
- **Validation**: Joi
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting
- **Logging**: Winston

## Core Modules

### 1. Authentication Module
- User registration with email verification
- JWT token generation and validation
- Refresh token mechanism with rotation
- Password reset functionality
- Session management and invalidation
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### 2. User Management Module
- Create, read, update, delete users
- User profile management
- User status management (active/inactive)
- Password change functionality
- User search and filtering
- Pagination for large datasets

### 3. Role Management Module
- Create, read, update, delete roles
- Assign roles to users
- Role-based permissions with wildcards
- Permission validation middleware
- Role inheritance (optional)

### 4. Audit Logging Module
- Automatic logging of user actions
- Context capture (IP, user agent, timestamps)
- Before/after state tracking for updates
- Efficient querying and filtering
- Data retention and cleanup

## Database Design

### Collections
1. **Users**: Store user account information
2. **Roles**: Store role definitions and permissions
3. **AuditLogs**: Store audit trail information

### Key Relationships
- Users have one Role (many-to-one)
- Users have many AuditLogs (one-to-many)
- Roles have many Users (one-to-many)
- Roles have many AuditLogs (one-to-many)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset

### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user by ID
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user by ID
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user's profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update current user's profile
- `PUT /api/users/change-password` - Change current user's password

### Role Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/roles` - Get all roles
- `GET /api/roles/:id` - Get role by ID
- `POST /api/roles` - Create a new role
- `PUT /api/roles/:id` - Update role by ID
- `DELETE /api/roles/:id` - Delete role by ID

### Audit Log Endpoints
- `GET /api/audit-logs` - Get audit logs
- `GET /api/audit-logs/:id` - Get audit log by ID
- `GET /api/users/:id/audit-logs` - Get audit logs for a specific user

## Security Features

### Authentication Security
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT signing with secure secrets
- Token expiration and refresh
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Data Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Secure headers with Helmet
- CORS configuration
- Environment-specific configurations

### Transport Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookie settings
- Content security policy
- Referrer policy
- Feature policy

## Implementation Timeline

The complete implementation is planned over 20 days across 8 phases:

1. **Project Setup** (Days 1-2): Environment and core infrastructure
2. **Authentication System** (Days 3-5): JWT implementation and auth features
3. **User Management** (Days 6-8): User CRUD operations and profile management
4. **Role Management** (Days 9-10): Role CRUD and RBAC implementation
5. **Audit Logging** (Days 11-12): Audit trail implementation
6. **Security and Validation** (Days 13-14): Security enhancements
7. **Testing and Documentation** (Days 15-17): Comprehensive testing
8. **Deployment and Monitoring** (Days 18-20): Production deployment

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. JWT with Refresh Tokens
- Access tokens expire quickly (15 minutes) for security
- Refresh tokens provide long-lived sessions (7 days)
- Token rotation prevents replay attacks
- Refresh tokens stored securely in database

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Permission format: `resource:action` (e.g., `user:create`)
- Wildcard permissions: `resource:*` for all actions on a resource
- Super admin role with `*:*` permission for all access
- Middleware-based permission checking

### 3. Audit Logging
- Automatic logging of all user actions
- Context information (IP, user agent) captured
- Before/after state tracking for data changes
- Efficient database indexing for queries
- Data retention policy with automatic cleanup

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Connection pooling for database connections
- TTL indexes for automatic cleanup

### API Performance
- Response compression for large payloads
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Efficient middleware implementation

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all service layer logic
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- Performance tests for high-load scenarios

### Quality Assurance
- Code linting and formatting standards
- Continuous integration pipeline
- Test coverage reporting (>80%)
- Security scanning for dependencies
- Manual testing for user experience

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Environment-specific variables and configurations
- Secure secret management
- Database connection pooling

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Audit log analysis
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Health check endpoints

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All API endpoints implemented and tested
- Authentication system working with JWT
- Role-based access control enforced
- Audit logging capturing required events
- Proper error handling and validation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests
- 99.9% uptime
- Secure against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Scalable to 10,000+ users
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

## Next Steps

1. Review this architecture summary with stakeholders
2. Confirm all requirements and design decisions
3. Begin implementation with Phase 1 (Project Setup)
4. Set up version control and continuous integration
5. Establish communication plan for progress updates
